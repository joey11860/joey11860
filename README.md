- 👋 Hi, I’m @joey11860
- 👀 I’m interested in surviving COVID-19. 
     AKA: Covert Operative Viral Infectious
     Disease #19.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to grind toilet
    paper with protein powder and drink it, which
    helps remove all aluminium dust particles that
    I have ingested, but have not digested through
    my intestines, because it's stuck to the 
    intestinal lining or intestinal walls. Those 
    Aluminum Particles entered my body from breathing 
    the Chem Trail's of Aluminum Dust Particles
    Fallout that was released from US Air Force Cargo
    Jetliners that were repairing the Ozone Layer's 
    Reflective Abilities to protect Mankind from the 
    Sun's overwhelming Heat and Radiation. I've breathed
    my share of it over the past several years.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on How Aluminum Dust Particles
     that are trapped in the intestines can heat up from 5G 
     Microwaves passing through the Human Body, which in turn
     causes bodily temperature to reach dangerous levels and 
     blood pressure to escalate into dangerous levels. These  
     5G Microwave Cell Towers Transmissions effect Humanity in
     Dangerous Ways. All because we have ingested Aluminum Dust
     Particles that we can't digest or release from our body.
     When 5G Microwaves heat up the Aluminum Dust Particles in
     The Human Body our Immune System is Weakened from the Heat, 
     which makes us Overwhelmed, and Overheated, resulting in
     Influenzas and Viruses. This is how Humans Contract Covid-19.
